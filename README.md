# Pomodoro + Task Manager with React/TypeScript

Pomodoro Timer with Task Management system. The application uses an interface similar to Trello for tickets with the added functionality of containing a timer in it which will track how many blocks of 25 min the task has consumed. The idea is to help developers focus on tasks while keeping track of the time they've spent on the ticket.
